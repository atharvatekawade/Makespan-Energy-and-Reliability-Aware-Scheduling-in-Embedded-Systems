# Makespan-Energy-and-Reliability-Aware-Scheduling-in-Embedded-Systems

This problem is of scheduling applications modeled as a directed acyclic graph to minimize total execution time and energy consumption subject to reliability constraints in a multiprocessor embedded system. In particular, our algorithm performs better than others as reliability constraint gets tighter Our proposed methodology is compared with the following state-of-art algorithms
